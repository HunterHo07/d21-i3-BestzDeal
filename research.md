### Target Market
- **Primary**: Value-conscious consumers (25-45) who research extensively before purchasing
- **Secondary**: Busy professionals (30-55) who value time savings over extensive research
- **Tertiary**: Small to medium-sized businesses seeking competitive bids for supplies

### Market Size
- Global e-commerce market: $5.7 trillion (2022)
- Reverse auction segment: Estimated at $27 billion with 15% YoY growth
